This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Overview

This project is a facebook messenger clone, built using React in an attempt to duplicate facebook's messenger. It is still a work in progress, but is functional.

This project was inspired and taught by Sonny and Qazi at Clever Programmer:

## Wishlist

- Messages to flow from the bottom up like FB messenger
- Login page so prompt isn't necessary
- Timestamps under messages
